Rice BIOE 421/521 Final Project - we're making turn signals for bikes!

Project Abstract
Team 2
Natalie Bolton & Saheba Bhatnagar

Are you an avid cyclist in Houston? If so, we admire your bravery. It’s a dangerous world out there, with inattentive drivers, maybe 100ft of bike lanes per square mile, and bumpy gravelly roads. We figure the least we can do to help is to increase your safety on the roads. For our project, we will create an attachable turn-signal system for bikes. The user will activate turn-signals using buttons on the handlebars. These buttons will have RF transmitters, which will communicate with the RF receiver attached to the microcontroller (probably an Arduino) connected to the signaling LEDs. This way, the biker will not have to shift/move their hands in order to press the button. The turn signals themselves will attach via a cinch system such that they can be attached to any kind of bike, on any part of your bike (although the bike seat post is recommended). 
While there are similar products available, customers have complained that the device physically falls apart or stops working soon after purchase. Besides producing a better-quality product, we will distinguish our product in the following ways: 
Turn signal LEDs for both the front and back of the bike, an uncommon feature on the market.
Easily accessible buttons on the handlebar instead of a remote that would be difficult to use while biking.
Satisfying clicking sounds activated by the turn signal, similar to that of a car.
Rechargeable crank battery powered by your bike. Be extra eco-friendly by not only biking, but by powering your light system with your own two legs! 
Additional features if we have time:
An automated white light for night-time riding that would automatically turn on if it is dark outside
Automated brake lights will turn on whenever you clench the brakes, using the same RF communication system. We put this in the “additional features” section, because we are concerned that this might be a more hardware/parts/design heavy feature. We want to prioritize adding features that require the skills we learned in class/lab thus far.
