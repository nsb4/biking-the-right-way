Rice BIOE 421/521 Final Project - we're making turn signals for bikes!

Project Abstract
Team 2
Natalie Bolton & Saheba Bhatnagar

Are you an avid cyclist in Houston? If so, we admire your bravery. It’s a dangerous world out there, with inattentive drivers, maybe 100ft of bike lanes per square mile, and bumpy gravelly roads. We figure the least we can do to help is to increase your safety on the roads.
To enhance biker safety, we will build an attachable turn-signal system that can be attached to any kind of bike. The user can activate turn-signals using buttons, which are attached to the handlebars for convenient access. These buttons will have RF transmitters, which will communicate with the RF receiver attached to the microcontroller (probably an Arduino). When the buttons are pressed, the microcontroller will then activate LED panels that display the turn signals.
While there are similar products available, customer reviews suggest that such products fail soon after purchase. In addition to a longer lifetime, we plan to design a superior product with the following unique features:
·       Turn-signal LEDs on both the front and back of the bike
·       Easily accessible buttons on the handlebar
·       Clicking sounds activated by the turn signal, similar to that of a car.
·       Rechargeable crank battery powered by your bike. Be extra eco-friendly by not only biking, but by powering your light system with your own two legs!
Future development of the product will focus on:
·       An automated white light for night-time riding that would automatically turn on if it is dark outside
·       Automated brake lights will turn on whenever you clench the brakes, using the same RF communication system.
