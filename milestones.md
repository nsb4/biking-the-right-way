# Bike Turn Signals Natalie & Saheba
## Milestones

1. November 2nd: Abstract submitted
2. November 2nd: Design code flow chart, start making code skeleton, use Circuit Playground capacitive touch and LED to model how the buttons and LED panel would work (code so that when we touch a capacitor on the left vs the right, then the corresponding buttons would light up). It should blink every second, and turn off when pressed again.
Google source code for RF receiver/transmitter code
3. November 5th: assemble all hardware components with microcontroller
4. November 9th: 1st Prototype Due. Have working hardware (with RF transmitter/receiver) and code for turn signals
5. November 16th: Fit and Finish Due
6. November 28th: Source Code Due
7. Novebmer 30th: Final Presentation
